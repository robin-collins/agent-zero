## Task Scheduling System

### Core Components

Agent Zero's scheduling system is built around three primary task types, each serving different use cases:

#### 1. ScheduledTask (`TaskType.SCHEDULED`)
- **Purpose**: Recurring tasks using cron-like syntax
- **Implementation**: `python/helpers/task_scheduler.py:278`
- **Key Features**:
  - Cron expression validation with regex patterns
  - Timezone-aware scheduling
  - Automatic execution based on schedule
  - State management (IDLE, RUNNING, DISABLED, ERROR)

```python
class TaskSchedule(BaseModel):
    minute: str      # 0-59, *, */5, etc.
    hour: str        # 0-23, *, */2, etc.
    day: str         # 1-31, *, */7, etc.
    month: str       # 1-12, *, JAN-DEC, etc.
    weekday: str     # 0-6, *, MON-SUN, etc.
    timezone: str    # UTC, America/New_York, etc.
```

#### 2. PlannedTask (`TaskType.PLANNED`)
- **Purpose**: Todo-style tasks with specific execution times
- **Implementation**: `python/helpers/task_scheduler.py:356`
- **Key Features**:
  - Datetime-based todo lists
  - Progressive state tracking (todo → in_progress → done)
  - Automatic state transitions
  - Sorted execution order

```python
class TaskPlan(BaseModel):
    todo: list[datetime]        # Scheduled execution times
    in_progress: datetime | None # Currently executing item
    done: list[datetime]        # Completed items
```

#### 3. AdHocTask (`TaskType.AD_HOC`)
- **Purpose**: One-time tasks triggered by tokens or manual execution
- **Implementation**: `python/helpers/task_scheduler.py:234`
- **Key Features**:
  - Token-based triggering
  - Immediate or on-demand execution
  - Random token generation for security

### Task Lifecycle Management

#### State Machine
```
IDLE → RUNNING → IDLE (success)
     ↓         ↓
   DISABLED   ERROR
```

#### Execution Flow
1. **Task Creation**: Via API or scheduler tool
2. **Scheduling**: Added to `SchedulerTaskList` with persistence
3. **Execution**: Background tick process checks due tasks
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time state updates and logging
5. **Completion**: Results stored with timestamp

### Persistence & Storage

Tasks are persisted in `tmp/scheduler/tasks.json` with:
- Atomic updates using thread locks
- Automatic reload mechanisms
- Serialization/deserialization for complex types
- Backup and recovery capabilities

---

## Memory System Architecture

### Core Memory Areas

The memory system (`python/helpers/memory.py`) organizes information into distinct areas:

#### 1. Memory.Area.MAIN
- **Purpose**: General agent memories and user interactions
- **Storage**: Vector embeddings with metadata
- **Retrieval**: Similarity search with configurable thresholds

#### 2. Memory.Area.FRAGMENTS
- **Purpose**: Conversation fragments and context pieces
- **Usage**: Automatic summarization and recall
- **Lifecycle**: Managed by extensions during message loops

#### 3. Memory.Area.SOLUTIONS
- **Purpose**: Successful problem-solving patterns
- **Benefits**: Learning from past successes
- **Location**: `knowledge/default/solutions/` and `knowledge/custom/solutions/`

#### 4. Memory.Area.INSTRUMENTS
- **Purpose**: Tool descriptions and custom scripts
- **Storage**: `instruments/` directory with markdown descriptions
- **Integration**: Loaded into memory for agent recall

### Vector Database Implementation

#### Technology Stack
- **Database**: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- **Embeddings**: LiteLLM with multiple provider support
- **Caching**: LocalFileStore for embedding cache
- **Distance**: Cosine similarity with normalization

#### Memory Operations
```python
# Core operations available
await memory.search_similarity_threshold(query, limit, threshold)
await memory.insert_text(text, metadata)
await memory.insert_documents(docs)
await memory.delete_documents_by_query(query, threshold)
await memory.delete_documents_by_ids(ids)
```

### Behavioral Memory

#### Dynamic Behavior Adjustment
- **File**: `memory/behaviour.md` (per agent context)
- **Tool**: `behaviour_adjustment.py` for runtime modifications
- **Persistence**: Automatic saving and loading
- **Scope**: Context-specific behavioral rules

#### Behavior Merging Process
1. **Current Rules**: Read existing behavior file
2. **Adjustments**: New rules or modifications
3. **LLM Processing**: Utility model merges rules intelligently
4. **Persistence**: Updated rules saved to memory

---

## Calendar & DateTime Functionality

### Timezone Support

#### Localization System
- **Class**: `Localization` singleton for timezone management
- **Default**: UTC with automatic conversion
- **User Preferences**: Configurable timezone per user/session
- **Serialization**: ISO format with timezone information

#### DateTime Handling
```python
# Timezone-aware datetime operations
serialize_datetime(dt: datetime) -> str
parse_datetime(dt_str: str) -> datetime
localtime_str_to_utc_dt(dt_str: str) -> datetime
```

### Cron Expression Support

#### Validation & Parsing
- **Regex Validation**: `^((((\d+,)+\d+|(\d+(\/|-|#)\d+)|\d+L?|\*(\/\d+)?|L(-\d+)?|\?|[A-Z]{3}(-[A-Z]{3})?) ?){5,7})$`
- **Library**: `crontab` Python library for parsing
- **Features**: Standard cron syntax with extensions

#### Schedule Calculation
- **Next Run**: Calculates next execution time
- **Due Tasks**: Identifies tasks ready for execution
- **Frequency Check**: Configurable check intervals (default 60s)

    verify_func: Callable = lambda task: True,
    **update_params
) -> Union[ScheduledTask, AdHocTask, PlannedTask] | None:
    """Atomically update task with verification"""
    with self._lock:
        await self.reload()  # Ensure latest state
        task = next((t for t in self.tasks if t.uuid == task_uuid and verify_func(t)), None)
        if task:
            task.update(**update_params)
